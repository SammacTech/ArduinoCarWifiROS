=================

This repository contains all the information you need for creating a mobile robot based on Arduino and controlled by ROS. As extra items, it uses an Arduino UNO working as a SCADA system.

If you switch between the repository's branches you can find the same files available in other languages.

You can see the final project working at:

*************************************** BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS ************************************************* 

Build all the files following the instructions given in the tutorials of wiki.ros (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

We have created 2 packages: one called publisher_2socket that contains both publishers and another one called subscriber_2socket that contains both subscribers.

If you try to repeat this structure, you will have something similar to: 

workspace/

		src/ 
		
			file.h attached 
			Several Packages...

** DONT FORGET CHANGING THE LIBRARY PATH IN ALL THE FILES
