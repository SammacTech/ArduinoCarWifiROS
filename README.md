=================
Build all the files following the instructions given in the tutorials of wiki.ros (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)


We have created 2 packages: one called publisher_2socket that contains both publishers
and another one called subscriber_2socket that contains both subscribers.

If you try to repeat this structure, you will have something similar to:
workspace/
		src/
			file.h attached
			Several Packages...



** DONT FORGET CHANGING THE LIBRARY PATH IN ALL THE FILES
